# üåü React SWC Starter With Vite

This project built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.

## Starter Introduction

This application use DDD pattern. Here you can learn a little about DDD pattern, [Visit me](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-driven-design-ddd)

## üèÜ Tips

Here's my opinions for write our code more clean and readable. So, you can follow it or ignore it.

1. Always using namespacing on your custom hooks, constants, etc on your domain. Example:

```bash
export const useAuthenticationHook = () => {
  /**
   * @description Reactive data binding
   */
  const [authentication_accessToken, setAuthentication_accessToken] = useState();
  const [authentication_form, setAuthentication_form] = useState();
  ...
```

Reason: We normally read things from left to right, top to bottom. As a result, when using namespacing, we should be able to directly determine who owns variables, functions, and so on.

Side Effect: The use of namespacing can sometimes result in longer naming of variables, functions, and so on. However, we still have code that is easier to read than if we did not utilize namespacing at all.

2. Order naming your variables, function, etc to ascending.

```bash
export const useAuthenticationHook = () => {
  /**
   * @description Reactive data binding
   */
  const [authentication_accessToken, setAuthentication_accessToken] = useState();
  const [authentication_form, setAuthentication_form] = useState();

  const authentication_onCancel = () => {
     // Do something here
  }

  const authentication_onSubmit = () => {
     // Do something here
  }

  return {
    authentication_accessToken,
    authentication_form,
    authentication_onSubmit
  }
```

Reason: One of the most important reasons for creating variables, functions, and so on in ascending sequence is to make things easier while troubleshooting or adding features.

### Conclusion:

Actually, there are plenty other approaches to make our code cleaner and easier to read for humans. However, at this time, I'd want to underline the two points listed above. Because, as previously said, I am using the same code approach in my project.

As a result, I ask any creators who want to participate in this project to keep the previously created code consistent.

## üìñ Notes

When we wish to include a new package or library into this project. I ask that you first conduct some study on the package or library that you intend to utilize.

When it comes to adding a new package or library, there are various factors to consider. Among them are:

1. Is the package or library frequently updated by its creator?
2. Is the package or library popular with other developers?
3. Does the package or library have a lot of issues?
4. Is the package or library small in size?
5. Is the package or library simple to use and has a big impact on our project? etc.

I believe we can add the desired package or library once it has passed the five criteria outlined above. However, if you wish to start a conversation regarding the package or library you want to add, please do so in the project's discussion thread on GitHub.
